🏛️ Civic Transparency Platform
An AI & No-Code Powered System for Public Project Transparency
🧩 What Is Our Product?

Civic Transparency Platform is a citizen-focused transparency tool that helps people see, verify, and understand public infrastructure projects happening in their local areas (wards).

The platform shows:

Which projects are happening

Where they are happening

Whether they are actually progressing

How transparent the execution is

This project was built entirely using No-Code tools and AI-powered platforms, without traditional backend development.

🚨 Problem Statement
The Real Problem We Identified

In real life:

Citizens don’t know whether public projects are genuinely progressing

Project updates are:

Delayed

Manual

Not citizen-accessible

There is no simple system for:

Ward-level visibility

Real-time updates

Easy verification

Why Existing Systems Fail

Heavy technical infrastructure

Not designed for public understanding

No real-time visibility

Not usable by non-technical administrators

💡 Our Solution

We created a No-Code + AI driven civic transparency system where:

Data lives in Google Sheets (easy for admins)

Forms collect citizen inputs

Automation tools sync & update data

AI assists design, visuals, and logic

Website auto-updates and displays insights

No servers.
No complex backend.
No manual deployments.

🧠 AI & No-Code Tools Used (ACTUAL TOOLS)

Below is exactly what tools were used and how.

1️⃣ Google Sheets – No-Code Database
What It Was Used For

Google Sheets acts as the central database of the entire system.

What Data It Stores

Project ID

Ward / Area (Ward A, Ward B, Ward C)

Project description

Start date

End date

Budget

Status-related fields

Why This Matters

Anyone (non-technical admin) can update data

Changes reflect immediately on the platform

No database setup required

2️⃣ AI Form Builder (DALL·E / AI Design Assistance)
What It Was Used For

Designing and structuring citizen verification forms

Creating clean UI ideas for:

“Verify a Project”

Citizen input flow

Call-to-action sections

Why AI Was Used Here

Faster UI ideation

Better UX without designers

Consistent visual language

3️⃣ Automation Tool (e.g., n8n / similar automation platform)
What It Was Used For

Automating data flow between:

Citizen submissions

Google Sheets

Trigger-based updates (when form is submitted)

Example Automation Flow
Citizen submits form
        ↓
Automation tool triggers
        ↓
Data added to Google Sheet
        ↓
Dashboard updates automatically

Why This Matters

No manual data entry

Real-time updates

Scalable without coding

4️⃣ Vercel – No-Code Deployment Platform
What It Was Used For

Hosting the website

Auto-deploying updates

Why Vercel

No server configuration

Instant deployment

Reliable hosting for demos & judges

5️⃣ AI Coding Assistants (ChatGPT / Copilot-style tools)
What AI Helped With

Logic for:

Project status calculation

Progress percentage

Fixing bugs

Handling edge cases

Improving UI text and clarity

Important: AI assisted, not replaced thinking. All logic was reviewed and adapted manually.

🔄 End-to-End System Flow (Simple & Clear)
